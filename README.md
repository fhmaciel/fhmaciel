- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernando!
- 💞️ I’m interested in travel, history, videogames and a lot of things from the geek culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End.
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner FE projects and things related to it.

Feel free to check my work. I'm kind of new to it, but I'm getting better each day. I'm open for Jr. positions and for any advice that you feel it will help me in my journey.

Thanks for your visit and have a nice day! 😃
